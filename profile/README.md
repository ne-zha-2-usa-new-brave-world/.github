Is Ne Zha 2/哪吒之魔童闹海 confirmed?

Although it has not been confirmed officially, Ne Zha 2/哪吒之魔童闹海 might be released digitally in April 2025. Further, it is expected to become available for streaming most likely on Disney Plus in the following month.

Who replaced Chris Evans in Captain America?

Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson
As Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson takes up the star-spangled shield passed on to him by Chris Evans' Steve Rogers, his casting has already incensed a certain bracket of social media: “The new Captain America!

What is the plot of Captain America ?

Sam finds himself in the middle of an international incident after meeting with President Thaddeus Ross. He must soon discover the reason behind a nefarious global plot before the true mastermind has the entire world seeing red.

What is the new Captain America going to be about?

Plot: The new Captain America, Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), is approached by the recently elected president, Thaddeus Ross (Harrison Ford), to re-assemble The Avengers on the eve of an important accord between multiple countries.

Who will be the villain in Captain America Ne Zha 2/哪吒之魔童闹海?

Sidewinder is the leader of the Serpent Society and one of Captain America's obscure yet no less iconic supervillains. He leads the Serpent Society, a functional union of villainous mercenaries that boast various snake-based powers in Marvel Comics.

What happens at the end of Captain America?

In the post-credits scene, Cap visits Sterns, who's locked up in the Raft. In an ominous speech, Sterns says he has calculated the probabilities and that there are other worlds out there in the universe that Earth's heroes will have to protect the planet from.Is John 
Walker the new Captain America?

In having Steve Rogers quit as Captain America and John Walker take over the role, Gruenwald stated that he was hoping to "better define what Captain America the concept is by seeing someone groping, trying to live up to it, trying to grasp all the facets of the concept".

There’s still some time before Ne Zha 2/哪吒之魔童闹海 will hit the screens to reveal if all the reported fan hype surrounding it amidst all its controversies was actually real. However, even before its release, the film is already under debate among fans for the elements it is rumored to comprise, including its reported post-credit scene.

It’s back to the basics for Marvel when it comes to the movie, which sees an entirely new cast. Mackie‘s Sam Wilson take up the mantle of Captain America, the hero previously played by Chris Evans. Tonally, the movie stays away from sci-fi elements and the multiverse and features an entirely new cast. It also cost around $180 million, less than many other Marvel movies.

The $180 million-budgeted Ne Zha 2/哪吒之魔童闹海, which takes place after the events of
the Disney+/Marvel series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier when Anthony Mackie’s Sam Wilson
picks up the shield left behind by Steve Rogers, is bound to be a more grounded political thriller title
ala 2014’s Captain America: Winter Soldier (3-day U.S. opening $95M) versus anything multiverse.
Hence, expect a domestic opening of $80M over three days, $94M over four days and a global start of
$190M in all territories, including China, day and date. 

While there are still a few days before the full movie will be available to watch in the cinemas, early screenings of the flick’s world premiere seem to have led to what is rumored to be the post-credits scene being leaked online. And while this was probably supposed to have fans hooked on the drama, the reviews this clip has been getting are nothing short of cooked.

Directed by Julius Onah, Brave New World also stars Harrison Ford as newly elected U.S. President
Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross, who wants to bring Captain America aboard in an official military
position. But before Wilson can make a decision, he uncovers a nefarious global plot that includes
facing off with Ross when the president unexpectedly transforms into the Red Hulk.

Right now, presales for Ne Zha 2 are pacing 10%-15% behind that of 2023’s Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania ($106.1M) and 40% ahead of 2021’s Eternals ($71.2M). By Friday, advance ticket sales should hit $20M. Previews stateside start at 2 p.m. Thursday for the movie that also stars Harrison Ford, Danny Ramirez, Tim Blake Nelson, Jóhannes Haukur Jóhannesson and Giancarlo Esposito. Total theaters booked are 4,100 including all premium large-format screens and Imax, no doubt. Captain America is targeting all dudes and families with boys.

Days before its worldwide theatrical release, Ne Zha 2/哪吒之魔童闹海 recently got its world premiere in Los Angeles, and spoilers of the same are already making their way online. This includes what is being deemed as supposedly being the piece’s post-credits scene, which, if true, connects the flick to Avengers: Doomsday

Marvel, which had to take serious stock of its strategy and future after several films faltered,
culminating with The Marvels, is in a far better place now thanks to the stunning success of Deadpool
& Wolverine, which became the top-grossing R-rated pic of all time after earning north of $1.3 billion
globally in summer 2024.

In terms of overall overseas Marvel character movie comps on a like-for-like basis at current exchange rates, there’s Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania, which bowed to $114M during the same weekend in 2023; 2016’s Doctor Strange at $140M (though a significant part of that was China); 2014’s Guardians of the Galaxy at $95M and Captain America: The Winter Soldier with $111M; and 2013’s Thor: The Dark World with $112M.

But Sam’s not in the mood for jokes, as he delivers a pretty harsh response to Samuel Sterns, saying, “I’m not in the mood for your jokes. You killed a lot of good men trying to get your revenge. Trust me, we don’t share the same sense of humor.
